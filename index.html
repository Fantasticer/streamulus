          Streamulus is a C++ library that makes it very easy to process
          event streams. You need to write code that handles a single
          event and the library turns this code into a data structure
          that handles infinite streams of such events. The stream
          operators you write can have side effects and they can
          maintain an internal state.&nbsp; <a href="https://github.com/iritkatriel/streamulus/tree/master/examples">An
            example is worth a thousand words</a>. </p>
        <h5>Motivation<br>
        </h5>
        Continuous computations are not easy to write and maintain in a
        procedural language like C++. This <a
href="http://streamulus.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/problem-of-streams-why-do-we-need.html">blog


          post</a> describes some of the problems that Streamulus
        solves.<br>
        <br>
        Several previously existing stream processing systems chose to
        support a version of StreamSQL, which is a somain-specific
        language based on SQL but adapted to streams. Like SQL, it can
        be learned and used by non-programmers. <br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Streamulus takes a different approach to the stream processing
        problem, which may appeal to those of us who are programmers. By
        embedding the stream computations in C++, we end up with a
        highly expressive language. Streamulus uses template
        metaprogramming (TMP) techniques to transform simple expressions
        into a powerful stream-processing data structure <span
          style="font-style: italic;">during compilation time</span>.
        This means that we are processing the expressions early enough
        to apply optimizations that are not possible at runtime. Version
        0.1 barely scrapes the surface of what TMP can do. So far only the
        basic functionality has been implemented, but there is much more
        to come. Future releases will include optimisation that will
        significantly improve the efficiency of the data structure.<br>

        <p>The code contains some <a
            href="https://github.com/iritkatriel/streamulus/tree/master/examples">examples</a>
          that demonstrate usage of Streamulus.</p>

        <h5>Thanks</h5>
        <p>Streamulus relies on the Boost Proto library. I am grateful
          to Joel Falcou for his ongoing assistance and feedback. </p>
